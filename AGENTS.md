## Work Session Management
- Track work in `work/WORK-*.org` files (pattern: WORK-description-ticket.org)
- Start: Copy work/WORK-template.org to new file
- Always read and update: Objective, Context, Rules, Tasks (- [ ] format), Work Log
- Update task checkboxes as you progress: [ ] â†’ [X] when complete
- Add timestamped Work Log entries after each significant action
- Commit after each completed task with descriptive message
- Update WORK.org with session link and status
- End session: Run `/work-summarize` command
