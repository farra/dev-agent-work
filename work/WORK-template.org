** Rules
- Use the Tasks section below to track active work. Update it as tasks are added, completed, or split.
- For each task:
  - Clarify the objective. State any assumptions explicitly.
  - Decompose complex tasks into plans and subtasks.
  - When appropriate, challenge the task definition: suggest alternatives, simplifications, or improved goals.
- After each task or change, append an entry to the Work Log with:
  - What you did.
  - What you learned or decided.
  - Any questions, insights, or blockers that emerged.
- After each task is complete, commit to the git branch
- This document is the source of truth for project continuity. Update it so the project could be resumed cold from this file alone.
