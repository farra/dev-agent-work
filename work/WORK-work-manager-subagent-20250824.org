Create a work-manager sub-agent for Claude Code that automatically handles work tracking in the background while the main agent focuses on implementation. This sub-agent will proactively maintain the dev-agent-work system, sync with issue trackers, and ensure seamless work continuity.

** Context

Based on Claude Code's sub-agent functionality, we need to create a specialized agent that runs in parallel with the main coding agent. This will transform our manual slash command system into an intelligent, always-on work tracking companion.

Key requirements identified:
- Sub-agents operate in separate context windows with focused responsibilities
- They can be configured with specific tools and triggered proactively
- Best practice is single-responsibility agents with detailed system prompts
- Integration should be seamless and non-intrusive to main agent workflow

Current system relies on manual `/work-start`, `/work-sync`, `/work-summarize` commands. The sub-agent will automate these processes by monitoring file changes, task completions, and session state transitions.

** Rules
- Use the Tasks section below to track active work. Update it as tasks are added, completed, or split.
- For each task:
  - Clarify the objective. State any assumptions explicitly.
  - Decompose complex tasks into plans and subtasks.
  - When appropriate, challenge the task definition: suggest alternatives, simplifications, or improved goals.
- After each task or change, append an entry to the Work Log with:
  - What you did.
  - What you learned or decided.
  - Any questions, insights, or blockers that emerged.
- After each task is complete, commit to the git branch
- This document is the source of truth for project continuity. Update it so the project could be resumed cold from this file alone.

* Tasks
- [X] Check this off to confirm you've read the project and understand the rules
- [X] Design comprehensive work-manager sub-agent specification
- [X] Create .claude/agents/work-manager.md file with proper configuration
- [X] Define trigger conditions and proactive invocation patterns
- [ ] Implement automatic WORK file monitoring and updates
- [ ] Add intelligent issue tracker sync capabilities
- [ ] Create WORK.org maintenance functionality
- [ ] Test sub-agent with various workflow scenarios
- [ ] Update project documentation to include sub-agent usage
- [ ] Validate integration with existing slash commands

* Work Log
** <2025-08-24 Sat> Work session started
- Created WORK file for sub-agent implementation
- Defined objective based on previous planning discussion
- Established context from Claude Code sub-agent documentation research
- Ready to begin sub-agent design and implementation

** <2025-08-24 Sat> Sub-agent specification research completed
- Analyzed SuperClaude agent examples to understand patterns:
  - python-expert.md: Shows production-focus with clear triggers/boundaries
  - quality-engineer.md: Demonstrates systematic approach with risk assessment
  - requirements-analyst.md: Shows discovery-oriented agent with TodoWrite tool
  - socratic-mentor.md: Most complex example with learning orchestration
- Key patterns identified:
  - YAML frontmatter: name, description, category, tools
  - Clear trigger conditions for proactive invocation
  - Behavioral mindset and focus areas definition
  - Structured key actions and expected outputs
  - Explicit boundaries (Will/Will Not) for scope clarity
- Ready to design work-manager specification using these patterns

** <2025-08-24 Sat> Work-manager agent generated successfully
- Used /agents slash command with our crafted description
- Claude Code generated comprehensive .claude/agents/work-manager.md file
- Generated agent includes:
  - Excellent frontmatter with haiku model and proactive triggers
  - Clear responsibilities: file management, work logs, external sync, monitoring
  - Operational guidelines: silent background operation, atomic operations, retry logic
  - Quality assurance: validation, integrity checks, backup copies
- Agent description includes specific examples for when to use
- Ready to test and refine the generated specification

** <2025-08-24 Sat> Updated init-project.sh to include sub-agent
- Modified init script to create .claude/agents/ directory
- Added sub-agent copying loop to copy all *.md files from .claude/agents/
- Updated usage help and file listing to mention work-manager sub-agent
- Now new projects will automatically get the work-manager agent
- Complete dev-agent-work system now includes automatic work tracking
