# Work Session Summary and Update

Please summarize the current work session and update the work tracking files.

**Target Work File:** $ARGUMENTS (if provided, otherwise determine the current/active work file in ./work/)

## Instructions:

### 1. Identify Work File
- If $ARGUMENTS provided, use that work file in ./work/
- Otherwise, find the most recent or "current" work file in ./work/ directory
- Look for files with recent modifications or "STRT" (started) tasks

### 2. Update Current Work File
- **Update task status**: Mark completed tasks as [X] or DONE, in-progress as STRT, etc.
- **Update work log**: Add a new work log entry with:
  - Date/time stamp
  - Summary of what was accomplished this session
  - Key decisions made or insights gained
  - Any blockers or questions that emerged
  - Next steps or follow-up actions needed

### 3. Capture Lessons and Improvements
- **Lessons learned**: What worked well, what didn't, what would you do differently
- **Outstanding work**: What remains to be done, dependencies, blockers
- **Workflow improvements**: Suggest improvements to processes, documentation, or tooling based on this session's experience

### 4. Update WORK.org
- Add or update an entry in WORK.org referencing this work session
- Include:
  - Link to the work file: `[[file:work/WORK-filename.org][Brief Description]]`
  - Current status (In Progress, Completed, Paused, etc.)
  - Brief summary of progress
  - Priority level if applicable

### 5. Clarify Session Status
If the session status is unclear from the work history or tasks, ask the user:
- Is this work session complete or ongoing?
- Should this work be marked as: TODO, INPROG, DONE, BLOCKED, or CANCELLED?
- Are there follow-up sessions or work items that should be created?
- Should this be moved to a different section in WORK.org (Active, Completed, Blocked)?

## Expected Output:
- Updated work file with current task status and comprehensive work log entry
- Updated WORK.org with proper session reference and status
- Summary of lessons learned and workflow improvement recommendations
- Clear next steps or follow-up actions
